# Portfolio

![Vercel](https://vercelbadge.vercel.app/api/paynerg2/portfolio)

## Description

My personal portfolio website, featuring a handful of relevant portfolio projects, contact information, etc.
As I learn more and build more interesting projects, the content will be updated.

## Motivation

I wanted to try out an accelerated development process by using some newer tools like NextJS and ChakraUI to cut down on the time it took to put together this project.
I also wanted a slightly smaller project to use for setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions.

## Next Steps

-   Get data statically via a headless CMS, to allow for updated data without pushing changes to the source repo
